          Dean Crawford is a two time laureate of the most innovative and efficient energy solution’s award from The Solar<br></br>
          Impulse Foundation and Ambassador to Made in Wallonia.<br></br>
          <br></br>He is a two-time Honor graduate from the College of the United States Air Force in Electronics and Space Telecommunications<br></br>
          <br></br>He is considered a visionary, and is the inventor of The Planet Plug.<br></br>
          <br></br>“As a teenager growing up in rural North Carolina I recall experimenting with the 48 volts provided by the telephone<br></br>
          exchange located more than 30 miles away from our home.”
          <br></br>He has a professional career stretching back to 1980’s in the telecommunication industry, an industry powered by 48 volts.
          <br></br>He engineered 48 volt remote telecommunication sites in sub-Saharan Africa which compelled him to power his
          <br></br>entire home in Niger with 12 - 48 volts due to the absence of electricity in Niger.<br></br>
          <br></br>He produced the first know positive business case to solarize the thousands of remote telecommunication (BTS) sites
          <br></br>in sub-Saharan Africa in 2004.<br></br>
          <br></br>He predicted in 2014 that 50% of the household appliances in sub-Saharan Africa would be powered by 12 to 24 volts by 2035.
          <br></br>As of today approximately 25% of the home appliances in sub-Saharan (lights, fans, TV’s, refrigerators and freezers)
          <br></br>are powered by solar panels and 12 volts, and air-conditions with 24 volts.<br></br>
          <br></br>Coincidently he initials DC symbolize Direct-Current
